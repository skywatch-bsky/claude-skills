# Assess Account

This skill guides structured assessment of AT Protocol accounts. It defines what data to collect, how to classify the account, and what output to produce. The result is a consistent, repeatable assessment that replaces ad-hoc manual profiling.

Use this skill when you need to determine what type of account you're looking at (genuine, bot, IO, scam, spam) and what to do about it.

## Input

The skill accepts either a DID (`did:plc:...`) or a handle (`@user.bsky.social` or `user.bsky.social`). If a handle is provided, resolve it to a DID before proceeding — dispatch the data-analyst with: "Resolve this handle to a DID: [handle]". Use the resolved DID for all subsequent queries.

## Phase 1: Data Collection

Dispatch each of the following research questions to the data-analyst agent. Include the target DID and any relevant time constraints. The data-analyst formulates and executes the queries, returning results as markdown tables.

### 1. Rule Hit Profile

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Find all rule hits for DID [target_did] over the past 90 days. Group by rule name and show: rule name, hit count, earliest hit, latest hit, and sample content (first 3 hits). Also show the total distinct rules triggered."

**What this reveals:** Which rules trigger on this account, how frequently, and over what time range. High-volume single-rule hits suggest targeted behaviour. Hits across many rules suggest broad problematic activity.

### 2. Posting Patterns

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Show posting patterns for DID [target_did] over the past 30 days. Include: total post count, posts per day distribution, posting hours (UTC) distribution as a histogram, average inter-post interval, and day-of-week distribution."

**What this reveals:** Temporal regularity or irregularity. Bots post at consistent intervals; genuine accounts show natural variation. Around-the-clock posting without gaps suggests automation.

### 3. Entropy Analysis

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Query account_entropy_results for DID [target_did]. Return: hourly_entropy, interval_entropy, is_bot_like flag, and the evaluation timestamp. If no results, state that explicitly."

**What this reveals:** Statistical measures of posting regularity. See Classification section for threshold interpretation.

### 4. Content Themes

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Sample the 50 most recent posts from DID [target_did] from osprey_execution_results (use the content field). Return the post text, timestamp, and any rule that matched. Focus on distinct content — skip exact duplicates."

**What this reveals:** What the account talks about, content diversity, and whether posts are templated or varied.

### 5. Network Signals

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Check if DID [target_did] appears in any URL co-sharing clusters. Return cluster IDs, cluster sizes, and evolution types. Also check quote co-sharing clusters (`quote_cosharing_membership` and `quote_cosharing_clusters`)."

Additionally, use the `cosharing_pairs` MCP tool directly to check raw co-sharing edges for the target DID.

**What this reveals:** Whether the account participates in coordinated URL or quote sharing networks. Quote co-sharing clusters detect pile-on and brigading via coordinated quoting; URL clusters detect coordinated link pushing.

### 6. Infrastructure

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"Query account metadata for DID [target_did]: account creation date, PDS host, and any signup anomaly flags from pds_signup_anomalies (check if the PDS host appears with anomalous signup rates around the account's creation date)."

Use `domain_check` directly on any unusual PDS hosts identified.

**What this reveals:** Account age, hosting infrastructure, and whether the account was created on a PDS with anomalous signup patterns (mass-registration signal).

### 7. Overdispersion Context

**Dispatch to data-analyst:**
"For DID [target_did], check url_overdispersion_results to see if any domains shared by this account are flagged as anomalous. Return the domain, is_anomaly flag, volume_p_value, density_p_value, and sample_dids if the target appears. Also check quote_overdispersion_results — does any post by this account appear as a quoted_author_did with anomalous quoting rates? Return quoted_uri, total_shares, unique_sharers, and is_anomaly."

**What this reveals:** Whether the account shares domains being pushed by coordinated networks (URL overdispersion), and whether the account's own posts are being targeted by coordinated quote-post campaigns (quote overdispersion).

### 8. Ozone Moderation History

Use `ozone_query_statuses` directly with the target DID to retrieve the account's current moderation status — existing labels, review state, tags, and any open reports.

Use `ozone_query_events` directly with the target DID to retrieve the moderation event log — prior labelling actions, escalations, appeals, comments from previous reviewers.

**What this reveals:** Whether the account has prior moderation history, what labels have been applied or removed, whether it's been reviewed before and what the outcome was. An account with repeated label-appeal cycles or multiple prior escalations has a different risk profile than one with no moderation history.

### 9. Protocol-Level Profile

Fetch the account's AT Protocol profile record directly. Use the `describe_repo` PDSX tool (or Slingshot `com.atproto.repo.getRecord` for `app.bsky.actor.profile/self`) to retrieve the current profile — display name, bio, avatar, banner.

If the account's handle is a custom domain (not `*.bsky.social`), use `whois_lookup` on the domain to check registration age, registrar, and privacy status.

**What this reveals:** Profile presentation, potential impersonation signals (copied bios/avatars), and whether a custom domain handle was recently registered or uses privacy protection (common in coordinated networks).

### Handling Missing Data

Some queries may return no results (new accounts, accounts with no rule hits, accounts not in entropy results). This is expected — proceed with available data and flag gaps in the Classification phase. An account with minimal data produces a low-confidence assessment, not an error.

## Phase 2: Classification

### Load Policy Guidance

Check for a `.policies/` directory in the current working directory. Read all files within it — these contain label definitions, enforcement criteria, and policy guidance that inform classification decisions.

If `.policies/` also contains a `precedents/` subdirectory, read those files too. Precedents are prior analyst decisions on ambiguous cases that serve as case law for future classification.

Policy files may define:
- **Custom account types** — additional `account_type` values beyond the defaults below (e.g., `impersonation`, `csam`, `doxxing`). Add any custom types to the enum.
- **Custom signals** — additional entries for the Signal Catalogue. Integrate them under the appropriate category, or create a new category if the policy defines one.
- **Recommendation overrides** — policies may specify that certain account types or signal combinations require specific recommendations (e.g., "accounts matching [policy X] must be `label_and_escalate`"). These override the default recommendation mapping.
- **Policy-specific labels** — when a policy defines which Ozone label to apply for a given violation, record the label name alongside the recommendation.
- **Precedents** — prior analyst decisions on edge cases. Apply matching precedents to similar accounts rather than re-evaluating from scratch.

If no `.policies/` directory is found, proceed with the default schema below. Do not warn — the defaults are sufficient for general-purpose assessment.

Apply the following schema to the collected data, extended by any loaded policies. Every field must be populated — use "unknown" or "insufficient_data" when data is unavailable rather than guessing.

### Classification Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `account_type` | enum | `genuine`, `bot`, `io_suspected`, `scam`, `spam`, `hybrid`, `insufficient_data`, plus any custom types from `.policies/` |
| `confidence` | enum | `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `signals` | list | Evidence items supporting the classification (see Signal Catalogue below, extended by policy signals) |
| `topic_breakdown` | map | Topic -> percentage of content (e.g., `{"politics/elections": 70, "sports": 20, "other": 10}`) |
| `language_profile` | map | Language -> percentage (e.g., `{"en": 85, "pt": 15}`) |
| `narrative_alignment` | string | Summary of dominant narrative(s) the account pushes, or "varied/no dominant narrative" |
| `recommendation` | enum | `no_action`, `monitor`, `escalate`, `label`, `label_and_escalate` |
| `policy_basis` | string | Which policy from `.policies/` supports this classification, or "default schema" if no custom policy applies |

### Signal Catalogue

Classify by evaluating signals from each category. An account may exhibit signals from multiple categories — `hybrid` captures accounts showing mixed patterns.

#### Bot Signals
- **High hourly entropy** (>= 3.9): Posts are distributed too evenly across hours — genuine accounts have natural peaks and quiet periods
- **Low interval entropy** (<= 1.5): Time between posts is suspiciously regular — genuine accounts have variable intervals
- **is_bot_like flag**: Set by the entropy analysis pipeline when both thresholds are met
- **Templated content**: Posts follow repeating patterns with variable substitution (e.g., same structure, different URLs)
- **No engagement variation**: Consistent posting rate with no response to external events

#### IO (Information Operation) Signals
- **Single-topic concentration**: 70%+ of content focused on one political or social topic
- **Cluster membership**: Account belongs to a co-sharing cluster (URL or quote)
- **Narrative alignment**: Content pushes a consistent narrative across posts, especially if aligned with known state-linked messaging
- **Coordinated timing**: Posting times correlate with other accounts in the same cluster
- **New account + high activity**: Account created recently but posting at high volume on a single topic
- **State-aligned sources**: Shares domains associated with state media or known propaganda outlets

#### Scam Signals
- **Fundraising patterns**: Posts soliciting donations, cryptocurrency, or financial transactions
- **Urgency framing**: Language emphasising immediate action ("act now", "limited time", "don't miss out")
- **Impersonation indicators**: Profile mimics a known entity (similar handle, copied bio/avatar)
- **Suspicious URLs**: Shortened URLs, domains registered recently, or domains flagged by overdispersion analysis

#### Spam Signals
- **Commercial URLs**: Links to commercial products, affiliate marketing, or ad-heavy sites
- **Template repetition**: Same message posted repeatedly with minor variations
- **High volume, low engagement**: Many posts but minimal genuine interaction

#### Genuine Signals
- **Varied topics**: Content spans multiple unrelated topics
- **Organic engagement**: Mix of original posts, replies, reposts with natural variation
- **Established account**: Account age > 6 months with consistent but varied activity
- **Natural temporal patterns**: Normal hourly entropy (< 3.9) and interval entropy (> 1.5)
- **Diverse sources**: Links to varied domains, not concentrated on a few

#### Moderation History Signals
- **Repeat offender**: Multiple prior labels applied, especially if the same label recurs after appeals
- **Label-appeal cycling**: Pattern of label → appeal → removal → re-offence indicates deliberate boundary-testing
- **Prior escalation**: Account was previously escalated, suggesting known problematic behaviour
- **Clean history**: No prior moderation events — account has no prior flags (weighs toward genuine, but does not guarantee it)
- **Quote-post target**: Account's posts are being quoted at anomalous rates (quote overdispersion), suggesting it is a target of coordinated amplification or pile-on

### Confidence Determination

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **high** | 3+ strong signals from one category, no contradicting signals from another |
| **medium** | 2+ signals from one category, or mixed signals that lean one direction |
| **low** | Fewer than 2 signals, contradicting signals across categories, or insufficient data |

### Recommendation Mapping

| account_type | Default Recommendation | Override Conditions |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `genuine` | `no_action` | If in a co-sharing cluster: `monitor` |
| `bot` | `label` | If high-volume + harmful content: `label_and_escalate` |
| `io_suspected` | `escalate` | If strong evidence (high confidence): `label_and_escalate` |
| `scam` | `label_and_escalate` | — |
| `spam` | `label` | If part of a network: `label_and_escalate` |
| `hybrid` | `monitor` | Escalate if any component is scam or IO |
| `insufficient_data` | `monitor` | — |

### On Request: B-I-N-D-Ts Report

When a full report is requested, load the `reporting-results` skill and produce a report using the structured assessment as source material:

- **Bottom Line:** Account type + confidence + recommendation in one sentence
- **Impact:** Posting volume, reach indicators, cluster membership, rule hit counts
- **Next Steps:** Specific actions based on recommendation (monitor, label with which label, escalate to whom)
- **Details:** Full evidence trail from all 9 data collection categories
- **Timestamps:** Data collection time range, assessment timestamp

Select the **memo** report type for individual account assessments. Use **cell deep-dive** if the account is part of a larger network being investigated.
