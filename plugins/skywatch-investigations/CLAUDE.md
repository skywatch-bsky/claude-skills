# Skywatch Investigations Plugin

Last verified: 2026-03-29

## Purpose

Investigation toolkit for AT Protocol network analysis. Provides MCP tools for ClickHouse data access, domain/IP/URL reconnaissance, content similarity detection, and Ozone moderation labelling. Skills codify investigation methodology. Agents orchestrate the full workflow from brief to report.

## Architecture

Three layers — MCP server (native tool access), skills (codified methodology), agents (orchestrated workflows). The investigator agent delegates ClickHouse work to a data-analyst subagent while handling reconnaissance directly.

**Phase 1 Refactoring (2026-03-24):** Ozone tool internals refactored to extract reusable helpers: `validateOzoneConfig`, `buildSubjectRef`, `buildModTool`, and `ozoneRequest`. These enable future read tools and maintain zero-behaviour-change principle.

**Phase 3: Write Tools (2026-03-24):** Added 7 write tools (comment, acknowledge, escalate, tag, mute, unmute, resolve_appeal) that emit moderation events via Ozone `emitEvent` API. All use the `emitOzoneEvent` helper for consistent event construction with $type, createdBy, modTool metadata, and batchId support.

## Contracts

### Exposes

- **Agents**:
  - `investigator` — investigation orchestrator, dispatches data-analyst for ClickHouse queries
  - `data-analyst` — focused ClickHouse query agent
- **Skills**:
  - `accessing-osprey` — Osprey system context and schema reference
  - `querying-clickhouse` — ClickHouse query patterns and best practices
  - `conducting-investigations` — investigation methodology (reconnaissance, correlation, analysis)
  - `reporting-results` — report structure, formatting, and presentation
- **MCP Tools** (20 total):
  - `clickhouse_query` — Execute read-only queries (SELECT/WITH only, LIMIT required, JOINs/UNIONs/CTEs/subqueries allowed)
  - `clickhouse_schema` — Discover table structure and column definitions for all queryable tables
  - `content_similarity` — Detect text similarity via ClickHouse ngramDistance
  - `cosharing_clusters` — Find URL co-sharing clusters by DID, cluster_id, date, or minimum size (supports JOINs internally)
  - `cosharing_pairs` — Get raw co-sharing pairs for a specific DID with edge weights and shared URLs
  - `cosharing_evolution` — Trace a cluster's evolution history (births, merges, splits, deaths)
  - `domain_check` — Verify domain registration and WHOIS data
  - `ip_lookup` — Geolocate IP addresses via ip-api.com
  - `url_expand` — Expand shortened URLs to full targets
  - `whois_lookup` — Query WHOIS databases for registrant information
  - `ozone_label` — Apply/remove moderation labels via Ozone API (supports comment and batchId for grouping related label operations)
  - `ozone_query_statuses` — Query the Ozone moderation queue with filters for review state, tags, appeal/takedown status, and pagination
  - `ozone_query_events` — Query moderation event history with filters for event type, moderator, date range, and labels
  - `ozone_comment` — Add a comment to a subject's moderation record (supports sticky comments)
  - `ozone_acknowledge` — Acknowledge a subject, moving it from open to reviewed (supports bulk account acknowledgement)
  - `ozone_escalate` — Escalate a subject for higher-level review
  - `ozone_tag` — Add and/or remove tags from a subject's moderation record
  - `ozone_mute` — Mute a subject for a specified duration in hours
  - `ozone_unmute` — Unmute a previously muted subject
  - `ozone_resolve_appeal` — Resolve an appeal on a subject (requires comment)

### Guarantees

- Investigator NEVER writes ClickHouse queries directly — delegates to data-analyst
- All ClickHouse queries via `clickhouse_query` are read-only (SELECT/WITH only, LIMIT required, no semicolons, no INTO — JOINs, UNIONs, CTEs, subqueries, and any table are allowed)
- Co-sharing tools (`cosharing_clusters`, `cosharing_pairs`, `cosharing_evolution`) use `queryTrusted` to bypass validation for server-built queries with sanitised inputs (no LIMIT requirement)
- All Ozone tools require explicit credentials — fail gracefully without them
- Data-analyst always includes SQL used in its output (reproducibility)
- Investigation reports follow B-I-N-D-Ts format (Bottom Line, Impact, Next Steps, Details, Timestamps)
- **Ozone internals (Phase 1):** Reusable helpers are exported (`validateOzoneConfig`, `buildSubjectRef`, `buildModTool`, `ozoneRequest`) to support read and write tools. `ozone_label` handler uses these helpers with zero behaviour change.
- **Ozone write tools (Phase 3):** All 7 write tools use the `emitOzoneEvent` helper to emit proper event payloads via Ozone `emitEvent` API. Each tool enforces required fields: `ozone_tag` requires at least one of add/remove; `ozone_resolve_appeal` requires comment.
- All Ozone write tools include modTool metadata (`name: "skywatch-mcp"`, batchId) for traceability
- All Ozone write tools validate credentials before attempting API calls

### Expects

- ClickHouse direct access configured via env vars (`CLICKHOUSE_HOST`, `CLICKHOUSE_PORT`, `CLICKHOUSE_USER`, `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`, `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE`)
- Bun runtime installed for MCP server
- Ozone credentials (optional — only for read/write tools): `OZONE_HANDLE`, `OZONE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `OZONE_DID`, `OZONE_PDS`

## Dependencies

- **Uses**: ClickHouse (osprey_execution_results, pds_signup_anomalies, url/quote_overdispersion_results, account_entropy_results, url/quote_cosharing_pairs/clusters/membership tables), ip-api.com (GeoIP), WHOIS servers, Ozone API (read/write moderation events)
- **Used by**: Any Claude Code session with this plugin installed
- **Boundary**: Does NOT overlap with osprey-rules plugin (rule writing) or osprey-rule-investigator (rule project analysis). The `accessing-osprey` skill provides context about the Osprey system but directs users to osprey-rules for rule authoring.

## Gotchas

- MCP server requires Bun runtime — `bun` must be on PATH
- Ozone tools fail gracefully without credentials (clear error message)
- Ozone env vars (`OZONE_HANDLE`, `OZONE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `OZONE_DID`, `OZONE_PDS`) are NOT in `.mcp.json` — set them in `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.zshrc` to avoid committing secrets
- Ozone auth goes through the PDS (via `atproto-proxy` header), not directly to the Ozone service URL
- `content_similarity` depends on ClickHouse — recon tools work independently
- ip-api.com free tier has 45 req/min rate limit
- Investigator never writes queries directly; if you see it writing SQL, something is wrong
- Co-sharing tools use `queryTrusted` (bypasses SQL validator) — the queries are built server-side with sanitised inputs, not user-supplied SQL
- `clickhouse_query` allows JOINs, UNIONs, CTEs, and any table — the only restrictions are read-only (SELECT/WITH), LIMIT required, no semicolons, no INTO
- `url_cosharing_pairs`, `url_cosharing_membership`, `quote_cosharing_pairs`, and `quote_cosharing_membership` have 7-day TTL — queries beyond that window return no results
- `url_cosharing_clusters` and `quote_cosharing_clusters` have no TTL — cluster-level data is retained indefinitely
- Ozone `ozoneRequest` helper automatically retries on ExpiredToken with session refresh — no manual retry needed in consuming code
