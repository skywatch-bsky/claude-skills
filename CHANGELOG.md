# Changelog

All notable changes to skywatch-skills plugins are documented here.

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.9

**Added:**
- `labeling-standards` skill — standalone evidence comment standards for all Ozone label actions, extracted from `working-the-queue`. Defines required comment format (summary line + evidence section), citation thresholds (1 for post-level, 2 for account-level), and ClickHouse-first data sourcing cascade (ClickHouse → Slingshot → PDS direct)
- `PreToolUse` hook on `ozone_label` — hard-blocks label actions when the comment doesn't meet labelling standards (missing summary line, no evidence section, insufficient citations)

**Changed:**
- `working-the-queue`: evidence comment format now references `labeling-standards` skill instead of inlining the format

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.7

**Changed:**
- `working-the-queue`: reframed methodology as OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act) — observe the report, orient with context and policy, decide on classification, act on analyst-confirmed decisions
- README: added Policy Directory section documenting `.policies/` and `precedents/` conventions

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.6

**Changed:**
- Replaced confabulated "B-I-N-D-Ts" report format with BLIND (Bottom Line, Impact, Next Steps, Details) — the real structured briefing format from The Tongue and Quill
- Timestamps and AT-URIs now live in the Details section as evidence, not as a separate top-level section
- Renamed "cell" terminology to "cluster" throughout — report types are now memo, cluster deep-dive, cross-cluster, and rule check

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.5

**Fixed:**
- `working-the-queue`: added mandatory detail block template with structured format — profile fields, numbered posts with AT-URIs and verbatim text, moderation history, data sources, recommendation last
- `working-the-queue`: explicitly prohibits inventing alternative formats (e.g., "key evidence" summary sections) that replace content with editorialised characterisations
- `working-the-queue`: all posts reviewed must be listed — no curated subsets, no truncation, no placeholders

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.4

**Changed:**
- `working-the-queue`: every detail block now includes both profile context AND post content regardless of report type — post reports get the account's handle/displayName/bio, account reports get all reviewed posts with AT-URIs
- `working-the-queue`: subagent prompt now fetches profile via `get_record` as step 1 and returns all content verbatim — agent gathers evidence, analyst decides
- `working-the-queue`: explicit human-in-the-loop principle — no label applied without analyst confirmation, verbose output preferred

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.3

**Fixed:**
- `working-the-queue`: summary table is now an index only — removed Key Evidence/Reasoning columns that encouraged editorialised characterisations without content
- `working-the-queue`: detail blocks are the decision surface — must include full verbatim content (all posts reviewed with AT-URIs, profile display name and bio verbatim for account-level subjects), not summaries or samples
- `working-the-queue`: detail blocks must present factual content BEFORE the agent's recommendation, not instead of it

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.2

**Fixed:**
- `working-the-queue`: reports are nominations, not evidence — reporter comments direct investigation but cannot be used to justify applying or dismissing labels; classification based solely on the subject's actual content and behaviour
- `working-the-queue`: strengthened batch-level bias check — reporter comments are never evidence in either direction, every report requires verifying the subject's actual content regardless of comment quality

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.1

**Fixed:**
- `working-the-queue`: reporter comments matching label names (e.g., "Blue Heart" → `blue-heart-emoji`) are now treated as label nominations — factual claim is verified before classifying
- `working-the-queue`: added batch-level anchoring bias check — each subject evaluated independently regardless of patterns in other subjects in the same batch

## skywatch-investigations 0.23.0

**Changed:**
- `working-the-queue`, `assess-account`: supplement ClickHouse with PDS record fetching via PDSX `list_records` when ClickHouse returns insufficient content — ClickHouse covers ~2 months, not the full account history
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 3 label actions now require evidence comments with specific AT-URIs, verbatim post text, and editorial notes (minimum 2 cited posts per label)
- `working-the-queue`: `key_evidence` classification field now requires full AT-URIs for all cited posts
- `assess-account`: "Handling Missing Data" now distinguishes content gaps (must fetch from PDS) from non-content gaps (proceed with available data)

## skywatch-investigations 0.22.1 (pre-release)

**Fixed:**
- `working-the-queue`: reported content must be returned verbatim by subagents — never summarised, paraphrased, or excerpted
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 2 per-subject detail blocks now explicitly require character-for-character reproduction of reported content

## skywatch-investigations 0.22.0

**Changed:**
- Verified osprey schema against live ClickHouse
- Added missing data sources to investigation skills

## skywatch-investigations 0.21.0

- `conducting-investigations`: all ClickHouse queries across 6 phases now dispatched to Sonnet subagents instead of inline `clickhouse_query`
- `querying-ozone`: added delegation pattern section — reads to Sonnet, writes to Haiku
- `working-the-queue`: expanded subagent model table to include Ozone read queries and follow-up investigation

## skywatch-investigations 0.20.0

- `working-the-queue`: Phase 3 action execution (labelling, acknowledging, escalating) delegated to Haiku subagent
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 1 data collection subagents explicitly use Sonnet for speed
- `working-the-queue`: added model selection table documenting subagent model choices
- `working-the-queue`: primary triage agent can dispatch follow-up Sonnet subagents for additional investigation (ClickHouse queries, thread expansion, relationship checks, content similarity)
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 2 now shows reported content verbatim in per-subject detail blocks

## skywatch-investigations 0.19.0

- `working-the-queue`: added subject granularity rules — post-level subjects are not deduplicated; each reported AT-URI is reviewed individually
- `working-the-queue`: added `label_level` field (post/account) to classification schema
- `working-the-queue`: agent proactively recommends account-level labels when multiple posts or content context reveal systemic behaviour
- `working-the-queue`: added reply thread context requirements — replies must be evaluated against parent post, thread, account relationship, and reporter identity before classification
- `working-the-queue`: per-subject data collection delegated to subagents to preserve triage agent context window
- `working-the-queue`: subagents return a recommendation with supporting evidence, not just raw context
