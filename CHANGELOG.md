# Changelog

All notable changes to skywatch-skills plugins are documented here.

## skywatch-investigations 0.21.0

- `conducting-investigations`: all ClickHouse queries across 6 phases now dispatched to Sonnet subagents instead of inline `clickhouse_query`
- `querying-ozone`: added delegation pattern section — reads to Sonnet, writes to Haiku
- `working-the-queue`: expanded subagent model table to include Ozone read queries and follow-up investigation

## skywatch-investigations 0.20.0

- `working-the-queue`: Phase 3 action execution (labelling, acknowledging, escalating) delegated to Haiku subagent
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 1 data collection subagents explicitly use Sonnet for speed
- `working-the-queue`: added model selection table documenting subagent model choices
- `working-the-queue`: primary triage agent can dispatch follow-up Sonnet subagents for additional investigation (ClickHouse queries, thread expansion, relationship checks, content similarity)
- `working-the-queue`: Phase 2 now shows reported content verbatim in per-subject detail blocks

## skywatch-investigations 0.19.0

- `working-the-queue`: added subject granularity rules — post-level subjects are not deduplicated; each reported AT-URI is reviewed individually
- `working-the-queue`: added `label_level` field (post/account) to classification schema
- `working-the-queue`: agent proactively recommends account-level labels when multiple posts or content context reveal systemic behaviour
- `working-the-queue`: added reply thread context requirements — replies must be evaluated against parent post, thread, account relationship, and reporter identity before classification
- `working-the-queue`: per-subject data collection delegated to subagents to preserve triage agent context window
- `working-the-queue`: subagents return a recommendation with supporting evidence, not just raw context
